<h1>4 User Notes</h1>

<section id="SEC1">
<h2>4.1 Basic Concepts</h2>

<p>
mtDataWell is a program that provides random data and cryptographic functionality via a Graphical User Interface (GUI).  It offers features in 5 parts:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Random data creation.
</li>
<li>One time pad (OTP) creation and management.
</li>
<li>Encoding, decoding, encryption, and decryption of user files.
</li>
<li>Storing data within image and audio files using steganography.
</li>
<li>Applications of random data, such as password and pin number creation.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
To make operations easier to understand I have employed a simple metaphor:
</p>
	<blockquote>
	<strong>Random data is water</strong>.
	</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>A Well is the source of water.
</li>
<li>A Butt holds water taken from the Well.
</li>
<li>Soda is created by mixing water from the Butt with flavour.
</li>
<li>A Tap is used to funnel Soda into a Bottle.
</li>
</ul>

<section id="SEC11">
<h3>4.1.1 The Database</h3>

<p>
The database is the top level structure, and is a container for the other items
such as the Well, Butt, Soda and Tap.
It is stored in a location on the filesystem and contains various subdirectories
and data files.
</p>
<p>
The default location for the database is here:
</p>

<pre>
~/.config/libmtDataWell/
</pre>

<p>
mtDataWell can open different databases at different times which allows the user
to segment workflows according to need.  For example someone could use these
databases in their daily work:
</p>

<pre>
~/.config/libmtDataWell/
~/dw/mfi/
~/dw/aef/
</pre>

<p>
The first default item would be for general use, especially the apps (e.g. for
creating passwords).
The second could be for managing cryptographic data for MFI related work.
The third could be for managing cryptographic data for AEF related work.
This separation ensures that data flows are kept separate, unique, and makes
user mistakes less likely.
</p>

</section>
<section id="SEC12">
<h3>4.1.2 The Well</h3>

<p>
Each database has a Well which is user configured to produce random data on
demand.
This random data is created using a pseudo random number generator (PRNG), and
user provided real world entropy (files).
Due to the mathematical processes involved, a properly configured Well produces
random data that is cryptographically secure.
See <a href="chap_A.html#SEC1">A.1</a> for more details.
</p>

</section>
<section id="SEC13">
<h3>4.1.3 The Butt</h3>

<p>
Each database has a Butt which contains a number of OTP names which are used to
hold OTP data.  The Butt maintains all of the OTP accounting information to
ensure that data is only ever used once to encode Soda files.
</p>

</section>
<section id="SEC14">
<h3>4.1.4 The Soda</h3>

<p>
Soda files are created when an input file is mixed with Butt OTP data.
The original file can be extracted by reversing the process.
</p>

</section>
<section id="SEC15">
<h3>4.1.5 The Tap</h3>

<p>
The Tap creates FLAC or PNG Bottle files which hold Soda files.
This is a reversible process so the original data can also be extracted from a
FLAC or PNG Bottle file.
</p>

</section>
</section>
<section id="SEC2">
<h2>4.2 Running mtDataWell for the first time</h2>

<p>
When you run mtDataWell for the first time you should take the time to prepare
the database policies you plan to use later on.
</p>
<p>
For example, you may decide that the default database located at
~/.config/libmtDataWell/
is going to be used for the apps <strong>only</strong>, in which case you will need to choose files
for the Well that will always be present on your filesystem.
Also, you must only have a single, empty, read only Butt so that a user doesn't
accidentally use this database for OTP activity.
</p>
<p>
The other databases that you create will have read write Butts available.
However, in contrast to the files used for the default Well, they must only be
temporary and used when the Butt buckets are created.
After this process is finished the original files must be destroyed and the Well
file database must be emptied.
These are basic requirements for a secure and truly random OTP.
See <a href="chap_A.html#SEC1">A.1</a> for more details.
</p>
<p>
In practical terms, here is an example scenario for how to prepare Butt OTP
data:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Create some large video file(s) using a suitable camera device.
</li>
<li>Move the video file(s) onto the secure PC that you are using.
</li>
<li>Add the video file(s) to the Well.
</li>
<li>Create as many buckets as you will require for the tasks you plan.
</li>
<li>Once finished you must destroy the original video files to ensure that nobody
else can discover what you are doing and possibly re-create your OTP.
</li>
</ul>

<section id="SEC21">
<h3>4.2.1 Program Preferences</h3>

<p>
Whenever you change the size and position of the main window these details are
recalled for next time you use them.
These preferences are usually stored in the file
~/.config/mtdatawell-qt5/prefs.txt -
However this can be changed on startup by using:
</p>

<pre>
mkdir -p ~/.config/mtdatawell
mtdatawell-qt5 -prefs ~/.config/mtdatawell/prefs_profile_A.txt
</pre>

<p>
This is a useful way of having different profiles for different jobs, such as
dealing with a different set of databases as they will appear in the recently
used list.
</p>

</section>
</section>
<section id="SEC3">
<h2>4.3 User Interface</h2>

<p>
The main areas of the GUI are two file lists:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Input files.
</li>
<li>Bottle files.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Above the lists is the output path.  Each of these can be populated using the
buttons, or you can drag and drop a file from a file browser such as Thunar.
</p>
<p>
The status bar at the bottom of the UI is as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The currently open Database is on the left.
</li>
<li>The currently active Butt OTP is in the middle.
</li>
<li>The current Soda mode is on the right.
</li>
</ul>

<section id="SEC31">
<h3>4.3.1 Database Menu</h3>

<p>
You can use the Database menu to open or create a new database on the PC
filesystem.  You can also pick a database from the recently used list to quickly
load it back into mtDataWell.
</p>

</section>
<section id="SEC32">
<h3>4.3.2 Well Menu</h3>

<p>
The Well menu allows you to view and edit the current Well.  By pressing the
"Reset" button you will:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Empty the currently chosen file list.
</li>
<li>Create a new seed and set of shifts according to your PC's current time
settings.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
For more detailed settings press the "Information" button to reveal the current
state of the Well, and various options to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Add files or empty the list.
</li>
<li>Reset the seed or shifts.
</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section id="SEC33">
<h3>4.3.3 Butt Menu</h3>

<p>
The Butt menu enables you to study and edit the active OTP, as well as
having an overview of all the OTP's currently in the database.
</p>
<p>
To add more buckets to the active OTP, or to change the current comment,
use the "Active" tab.
The comment is a useful way of identifying what the purpose of this OTP is.
This information, or any other private information, should not be put in the OTP
name because the OTP name is kept in the Soda file and is not encrypted.
</p>
<p>
To add new OTP's, import some OTP data from another agent, or to delete an OTP
you use the "Overview" tab.
When creating a new OTP you are presented with a randomly created name.
Its usually a good idea to accept this, but if you want to change this for any
reason you can do this after pressing the "New" button.
</p>
<p>
A comment is also created automatically including the date, time, and user name.
If your organisation has any other policy requirements that need to be kept then
they should be put here, e.g. "Alice -&gt; Bob EOL 2019-12" may mean that Alice
uses this OTP to encode, and Bob uses it to decode (with destruction of the OTP
planned for December 2019).
</p>
<p>
Once the data has been created, you can analyse the data to ensure it is
statistically random.  Press the button <strong>"Butt-&gt;Analysis ..."</strong> to do this.
</p>

</section>
<section id="SEC34">
<h3>4.3.4 Soda Menu</h3>

<p>
The Soda menu enables you to encode and decode data files that you want to keep
private using OTP encryption.
</p>
<p>
To encode new file(s), firstly put the input filename(s) into the input
files listed in the main GUI window (drag and drop from a file browser or use
the "Open" button to manually select them).
After encoding using <strong>"Soda-&gt;Create File(s)"</strong> these new files will be dumped
into the output directory.
</p>
<p>
Remember to ensure the following when encoding:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The output directory must be read/write.
</li>
<li>Try to keep the output directory empty so you don't accidentally delete any
important data.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The decoding process is similar to encoding, i.e. you put the encoded files
in the left hand "Input Files" list and then simply use the
<strong>"Soda-&gt;Extract File(s)"</strong> menu option to extract the original file(s) into the
output directory.
</p>

</section>
<section id="SEC35">
<h3>4.3.5 Tap Menu</h3>

<p>
The Tap menu enables you to encode and decode Bottle files (PNG or FLAC
formats).  These Bottles are used to conceal Soda data that holds a file that
you want to remain private.
</p>
<p>
To encode new Bottle file(s), firstly put the input filename(s) into the input
files listed in the main GUI window (drag and drop from a file browser or use
the "Open" button to manually select them).
Then select the same number of Bottle files on the right hand list.
Finally select the output directory.
After encoding using <strong>"Tap-&gt;Create Bottle(s)"</strong> these new files will be dumped
into the output directory.
</p>
<p>
Remember to ensure the following when encoding:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The number of input files must match the number Bottle files.
</li>
<li>The output directory must be read/write as must the directory holding the
Bottle file(s).
</li>
<li>Try to keep the output directory empty so you don't accidentally delete any
important data.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The decoding process is similar to encoding, except you put the input Bottles
in the left hand "Input Files" list and then simply use the
<strong>"Tap-&gt;Extract File(s)"</strong> menu option to extract the original file(s) into the
output directory.
</p>

</section>
<section id="SEC36">
<h3>4.3.6 App Menu</h3>

<p>
Each of the applets in the App menu get their random data directly from the
Well.
</p>
<p>
If you want to use the data created in another program such as a text editor or
spreadsheet:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Select the text you want.
</li>
<li>Press Ctrl+C.
</li>
<li>Go to the other program and press Ctrl+V.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>4.4 Example OTP Scenarios</h2>

<p>
In the following examples, people need to communicate securely over an insecure
internet connection.
To do this safely, a secure PC (not connected to the internet) is used to create
the Butt OTP data.
This secure PC is used to create the encrypted Soda files which will then be
transferred to an internet connected PC to be emailed to somebody else who can
safely decode it on their secure PC.
</p>

<section id="SEC41">
<h3>4.4.1 Simple - 2 People</h3>

<ul>
<li>People: Alice, Bob.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Alice and Bob each create a new Database called "alice_bob_6".
Alice creates 100 buckets of OTP in Butt name "a_964".
Bob creates 100 buckets of OTP in Butt name "b_541".
This data is securely exchanged and copied to each others database that they
will use to encode and decode the files that will be transmitted later on.
</p>

<table class="tableborder">
<tr>
<td><strong>Person</strong></td>
<td><strong>Encoding Butt (read/write)</strong></td>
<td><strong>Decoding Butt (read only)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Alice</td>
<td>a_964</td>
<td>b_541</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bob</td>
<td>b_541</td>
<td>a_964</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Bob then leaves and travels to his new location ready to start his work.
As long as both continue to have secure PC's then nobody else can get the OTP
data and decode their communication.
</p>

<section id="SEC42">
<h3>4.4.2 Complex - 5 People</h3>

<ul>
<li>People: Aga, Carol, Grady, Polson, Skaggs.
</li>
<li>Organisations: MFI (Aga, Carol, Grady), AEF (Aga, Polson, Skaggs).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Aga, Carol, Grady each create a new database called MFI.
</p>
<p>
Aga creates a Butt OTP called "ac_478" and "ag_478" in the MFI database to
encode data to send to Carol and Grady.
</p>
<p>
Carol creates "ca_556" and "cg_556".
</p>
<p>
Grady creates "ga_983" and "gc_983".
</p>
<p>
Please note that I have chosen these names to make it easier to understand
what is going on.
In the real world you would use randomly created names in order to
avoid indicating to a snooper who the sender or the receiver is.
By default mtDataWell offers you a randomly created Butt name.
</p>
<p>
The three people in the MFI organisation exchange each others named Butt OTP
data so they can decode any files they receive later.
</p>

<table class="tableborder">
<tr>
<td><strong>Person</strong></td>
<td><strong>Encoding OTP (read/write)</strong></td>
<td><strong>Decoding OTP (read only)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aga</td>
<td>ac_478 - To Carol</td>
<td>ca_556 - From Carol</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aga</td>
<td>ag_478 - To Grady</td>
<td>ga_983 - From Grady</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Carol</td>
<td>ca_556 - To Aga</td>
<td>ac_478 - From Aga</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Carol</td>
<td>cg_556 - To Grady</td>
<td>gc_983 - From Grady</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Grady</td>
<td>ga_983 - To Aga</td>
<td>ag_478 - From Aga</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Grady</td>
<td>gc_983 - To Carol</td>
<td>cg_556 - From Carol</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Each person has a different OTP for each target just in case that person
becomes untrustworthy or their data becomes compromised.
For example if Aga is discovered to be an untrustworthy mole, this won't affect
the communication between Carol and Grady as Aga was never given their OTP
data:
</p>

<table class="tableborder">
<tr>
<td><strong>Person</strong></td>
<td><strong>Encoding OTP (read/write)</strong></td>
<td><strong>Decoding OTP (read only)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Carol</td>
<td>cg_556</td>
<td>gc_983</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Grady</td>
<td>gc_983</td>
<td>cg_556</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
If each person had used a single encoding Butt name, then this recovery scenario
would not be possible.
</p>
<p>
Aga, Polson, Skaggs each create a new database called AEF:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Aga creates a_478.
</li>
<li>Polson creats p_369.
</li>
<li>Skaggs creates s_571.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The three people in the MFI organisation exchange each others named Butt OTP
data.
</p>

<table class="tableborder">
<tr>
<td><strong>Person</strong></td>
<td><strong>Encoding OTP (read/write)</strong></td>
<td><strong>Decoding OTP (read only)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aga</td>
<td>a_478 - To Polson &amp; Skaggs</td>
<td>p_369 &amp; s_571</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Polson</td>
<td>p_369 - To Aga &amp; Skaggs</td>
<td>a_478 &amp; s_571</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Skaggs</td>
<td>s_571 - To Aga &amp; Polson</td>
<td>a_478 &amp; p_369</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The MFI organisation is rather more shoddy than the AEF, so they lazily only
created a single OTP Butt for each person.  Following from the earlier example
Aga is discovered to be a mole and as a result she has gained <strong>ALL</strong> of the OTP
data for the organisation which exposes everybody to having their communications
snooped on.
