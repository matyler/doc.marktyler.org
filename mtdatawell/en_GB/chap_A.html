<h1>Appendix A - Miscellaneous</h1>

<section id="SEC1">
<h2>A.1 Mathematical Randomness</h2>

<p>
Randomness can be many things, but for work relating to mtDataWell I define it as a combination of 3 things:
</p>

 <ul>
 <li><strong>Statistical randomness</strong>
   <ul>
   <li>In the long run, probabilities of bits &amp; bytes should tend to their average. e.g. 50% 0 bits, 50% 1 bits; 1/256 bytes should be 0x00, 1/256 bytes should be 0x01, etc.  This can be achieved by a PRNG using a linear congruential formula.
   <p></p>
   </li>
   </ul>
 </li>
 <li><strong>Unpredictable randomness</strong>
   <ul>
   <li>No mathematical formula or algorithm should be able to work out what comes next in a sequence of random data.  This is achieved using real world entropy via user data files that are mixed with PRNG data.
   <p></p>
   </li>
   </ul>
 </li>
 <li><strong>Unique randomness</strong>
   <ul>
   <li>Properly prepared data should never exist anywhere else, other than your secure device(s).  This is an absolute requirement for private cryptographic work, and requires a competent agent to handle and prepare the data.  This part can never be automated or delegated to a machine.  <strong>Hints</strong>: don't use a network enabled device to prepare or host the data; don't use hardware or software from which an adversary can snoop; feel free to wrap data inside multiple layers of encryption;
   </li>
   </ul>
 </li>
 </ul>

<p>
If these steps are followed then mtDataWell will create very high quality random
data.
</p>

<section id="SEC11">
<h3>A.1.1 Judging Random Quality</h3>

<p>
As with all computer programs, and data processing,
<strong>"garbage in, garbage out"</strong>.
The quality of the files you put into the Well will affect the "Unpredictable
randomness" item above.  For example, poorer quality input would be such as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple copies of the same file.
</li>
<li>Files which have large repeated sections within them.
</li>
<li>Files that have been created by a PRNG, or any other mathematical algorithm.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
When preparing you input data, try to avoid any of these as it will potentially
degrade the quality of the results due to lower levels of information entropy.
</p>
<p>
Measuring input file "quality" is difficult.  However, you can do various
analyses to ensure that the output is statistically random.
See <a href="chap_04.html#SEC33">4.3.3</a> for how to anaylse Butt data statistically to
confirm that your OTP's are good enough.
</p>
<p>
In order to avoid repetition through cycling in the Well input file data, always
ensure that there is far more data in the input files compared to the output
buckets.
For example if you want 1GB of buckets, ensure you have well over 1.5GB of input
data (input data is always deflated, so more is always required than you may
expect).
</p>
<p>
To increase the quality of input files, try and take as much data from the real
world such as first generation photos, or videos (i.e. that have not been edited
or recoded).

<h2>A.2 Soda OTP Logs</h2>

<p>
Soda encode transaction logs are kept in the database here:
</p>

<pre>
~/.config/libmtDataWell/soda/log.sqlite
</pre>

<p>
You can browse these using the sqlite command line tools or the sqlitebrowser
GUI tool.
